PYSIDE BROWSER

This is a little project I made in less than a day. It's a web browser written in Python using the PySide2.
It can currently do (most) things your run-of-the-mill browser can do, though it's still a work in progress.

If for any reason you want me to add something, you can send me an email at superslothsworld2@gmail.com.

Otherwise, just make sure PySide2 is installed (or manually reimport it to PySide6) and enjoy.
